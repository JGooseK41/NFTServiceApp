# NFT Service App - Current Issues Analysis

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

### 1. **Contract/Frontend Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Frontend expects `serveNotice()` but ABI only has `createLegalNotice()`
- **Impact**: View-gated features don't work (no agency info, case details, legal rights)
- **Current Workaround**: Using createLegalNotice with limited functionality

### 2. **IPFS Upload Failing**
- **Problem**: Netlify function returns 502 error
- **Impact**: Documents can't be uploaded, using mock hashes
- **Possible Causes**: 
  - Missing IPFS API credentials
  - Netlify function timeout
  - IPFS service endpoint changed

### 3. **Fee Exemptions Not Working**
- **Problem**: Contract functions are empty stubs
- **Impact**: Admin can't grant fee exemptions
- **Code**: `function setFeeExemption(address user, bool exempt) external onlyAdmin {}`

## ðŸŸ¡ Functionality Gaps

### 4. **Missing Contract Features**
- No real encryption for view-gated documents
- No resource sponsorship implementation
- No role management (grantRole is stub)
- No withdrawal function implementation

### 5. **UI/Contract Feature Mismatches**
- UI has "Full Service" option but contract doesn't support dual delivery
- UI expects serviceFeeExemptions/fullFeeExemptions but contract returns false
- Server registration stored in localStorage only (not on-chain)

## ðŸŸ¢ What's Working

1. Basic notice creation (without view-gating)
2. Alert NFT minting
3. Notice acceptance flow
4. Process server registration (localStorage only)
5. UI mostly complete

## ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive Fix Plan

### Option 1: Fix Current Contract (Minimal Changes)
1. Generate correct ABI from deployed contract
2. Update frontend to match actual contract functions
3. Fix IPFS with alternative service
4. Accept limitations (no view-gating, no fee exemptions)

### Option 2: Deploy New Fully-Featured Contract
1. Create contract with ALL features:
   - `serveNotice()` with all parameters
   - Working fee exemption mappings
   - Resource sponsorship
   - Proper role management
   - Encryption key storage
2. Match UI expectations exactly
3. Deploy and test thoroughly

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Use current contract for basic features
2. Add separate encryption service
3. Store metadata off-chain
4. Gradually migrate features

## ðŸš€ Recommended Solution: Option 2

Deploy a new contract that matches the UI exactly. This ensures:
- All features work as designed
- No workarounds needed
- Clean, maintainable code
- Full legal compliance features

## Next Steps

1. Review the current contract's actual ABI
2. Create new contract with all expected functions
3. Test locally with all features
4. Deploy to testnet
5. Update UI with new contract address
6. Fix IPFS or use alternative storage
