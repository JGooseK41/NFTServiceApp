# Energy Rental System Analysis & Fix Guide

## Current Issues

### 1. Undefined Variable Error (FIXED)
- **Location**: Line 294 in `js/energy-rental.js`
- **Issue**: Referenced undefined `minReasonablePrepayment`
- **Status**: âœ… Fixed

### 2. JustLend Contract Integration Issues

#### Problem Areas:
1. **Contract Address**: `TU2MJ5Veik1LRAgjeSzEdvmDYx7mefJZvd`
   - This appears to be a JustLend DAO contract
   - May not be the correct energy rental contract

2. **Method Call Issues**:
   - Trying to call `rentResource(address, uint256, uint256)`
   - Contract may use different method names or signatures
   - ABI might be incorrect

3. **Parameter Issues**:
   - Current parameters: receiver, trxAmount, resourceType (1 for energy)
   - JustLend may expect different parameters or format

## Why Energy Rental is Failing

1. **Contract Verification Fails**: 
   - The contract exists but doesn't have the expected methods
   - Lines 160-169 verify contract exists but methods don't match

2. **Method Not Found**:
   - Neither `rentResource` nor `order` methods exist on the contract
   - Line 376: "Neither order nor rentResource method found on contract"

3. **Transaction Reverts**:
   - Even if method is found, transactions are reverting
   - Possible reasons:
     - Incorrect parameters
     - Insufficient payment
     - Contract requirements not met

## Temporary Workaround (Currently Active)

When automated rental fails, the system:
1. Shows alternatives dialog to user
2. Options provided:
   - Burn TRX (proceed without rental)
   - Use external services (TRONEnergy.market)
   - Stake TRX for permanent energy
   - Cancel transaction

## Recommended Fixes

### Option 1: Disable Automated Rental
Since the fallback mechanism works well, consider:
- Removing automatic JustLend attempts
- Going directly to alternatives dialog
- This provides a better user experience

### Option 2: Fix JustLend Integration
To properly fix the integration:

1. **Verify Correct Contract**:
   - JustLend may have updated their energy rental contract
   - Need to find current mainnet contract address
   - Verify through JustLend documentation or support

2. **Update Contract ABI**:
   ```javascript
   // Need to get correct ABI from JustLend
   const JUSTLEND_ABI = [
     // Actual methods from JustLend energy contract
   ];
   ```

3. **Fix Method Calls**:
   - Determine correct method name
   - Update parameters to match contract requirements
   - Add proper error handling for specific revert reasons

### Option 3: Use Alternative Services
Instead of JustLend, integrate with:
- TRONEnergy.market API
- TRX.market API
- Other energy rental services with documented APIs

## Current User Experience

Despite the rental failure, users have a good experience:
1. System attempts automated rental
2. On failure, shows clear alternatives
3. Users can choose their preferred option
4. Transaction proceeds based on user choice

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on Mainnet Only**: Energy rental only works on mainnet
2. **Monitor Console Logs**: Extensive logging shows exact failure points
3. **Check Energy Calculations**: Verify estimates are accurate
4. **Test Fallback Options**: Ensure all alternatives work

## Temporary Fix Applied

```javascript
// Line 294 fixed - removed undefined variable reference
console.log('Prepayment calculation:', {
    rentalRate: actualRentalRate,
    totalSeconds,
    rentalCost: rentalCost / 1_000_000,
    minFee: minFee / 1_000_000,
    calculatedPrepayment: calculatedPrepayment / 1_000_000,
    finalPrepayment: totalPrepayment / 1_000_000
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **Short Term**: Keep current fallback system - it works well
2. **Medium Term**: Research correct JustLend contract and methods
3. **Long Term**: Implement proper integration or remove automated attempts

The system is functional with the fallback mechanism, so users can still complete transactions even though automated rental isn't working.
