# Critical Deployment Mistake Found!

## What Happened:
1. We created `LegalNoticeNFT_Complete_WithIPFS.sol` with IPFS metadata support
2. But the deployment script used the OLD contract files:
   - `LegalNoticeNFT_Complete.abi` (without IPFS)
   - `LegalNoticeNFT_Complete.bin` (without IPFS)
3. So we deployed the wrong contract twice!

## Evidence:
- The WithIPFS contract has `metadataURI` fields and IPFS support
- The deployed contract doesn't have these features
- The deployment script explicitly loads the wrong files (line 127-128)

## Why NFTs Don't Show:
- The deployed contract returns data URIs without image fields
- Wallets need IPFS URLs with proper image metadata
- The contract we meant to deploy has this support

## Next Steps:
1. Compile the WithIPFS contract properly
2. Deploy the CORRECT contract this time
3. Update the UI to pass metadataURI when creating notices

## The Good News:
- The WithIPFS contract already exists and has the features we need
- We just need to actually deploy it!
