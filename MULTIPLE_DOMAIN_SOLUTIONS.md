# Multiple Domain Solutions for NFTServiceApp

## Option 1: Multiple Domains on One Netlify Site (If Available)
Netlify *does* support multiple custom domains on one site, but this might depend on your plan. You can have:
- One primary domain
- Multiple domain aliases that redirect to the primary

**To check:** Go to Site settings → Domain management → Add custom domain

## Option 2: Two Separate Netlify Sites (Recommended)
Deploy the same codebase to two different Netlify sites:

### Setup Steps:

1. **Keep Current Site for theblockservice.com**
   - Your existing nftserviceapp site
   - Add theblockservice.com as custom domain

2. **Create Second Site for blockserved.com**
   - In Netlify: "New site from Git"
   - Connect to the SAME GitHub repository
   - Deploy with site name like "blockserved-app"
   - Add blockserved.com as custom domain

### Benefits:
- Complete control over each domain
- Can have different environment variables if needed
- Independent SSL certificates
- No domain limitations

### Deploy Settings for Both Sites:
```
Build command: (leave empty - no build needed)
Publish directory: /
```

## Option 3: Redirect Service
Use one Netlify site and redirect the second domain:

1. **Primary Site:** theblockservice.com (on Netlify)
2. **Secondary Domain:** blockserved.com
   - Use domain registrar's redirect service
   - Or use Cloudflare (free) to redirect to primary

## Option 4: GitHub Pages + Netlify
- Deploy theblockservice.com on Netlify
- Deploy blockserved.com on GitHub Pages
- Both from same repository

### GitHub Pages Setup:
1. In repo settings, enable GitHub Pages
2. Set custom domain to blockserved.com
3. Add CNAME file with: `blockserved.com`

## Recommended Approach: Two Netlify Sites

This gives you the most flexibility:

### Site 1: The Block Service
- URL: theblockservice.com
- Netlify site: nftserviceapp
- Shows: Process server features

### Site 2: Block Served  
- URL: blockserved.com
- Netlify site: blockserved-app
- Shows: Recipient features

Both sites deploy from the same GitHub repo, so any push updates both automatically!

## Quick Implementation:

1. **First Domain (existing site):**
   ```
   Site: nftserviceapp.netlify.app
   Custom domain: theblockservice.com
   ```

2. **Second Domain (new site):**
   ```
   Create new Netlify site
   Connect to same GitHub repo
   Custom domain: blockserved.com
   ```

The app's JavaScript will automatically detect which domain it's on and show the appropriate features!
