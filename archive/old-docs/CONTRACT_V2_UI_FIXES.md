# Contract v2 UI Fixes Completed

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. ✅ getNotice() → notices()
- Replaced all `getNotice(noticeId)` calls with `notices(noticeId)`
- This is the correct function name in the contract

### 2. ✅ tokenOfOwnerByIndex() → getRecipientAlerts()
- Replaced token enumeration with `getRecipientAlerts(recipient)`
- The contract doesn't have ERC721Enumerable, but has custom alert tracking
- Updated `getRecipientNoticeIds()` function to use the correct method

### 3. ✅ processServers() → Removed
- Process server info is not stored on-chain in this contract
- Replaced with role-based checks using `hasRole()`
- Server statistics now come from localStorage transactions

## Functions Verified Working:
✅ balanceOf() - Get NFT balance
✅ serviceFeeExemptions() - Check fee exemptions
✅ serviceFee() - Get service fee
✅ creationFee() - Get creation fee
✅ sponsorshipFee() - Get sponsorship fee
✅ grantRole() - Grant roles
✅ hasRole() - Check roles
✅ setFeeExemption() - Set fee exemptions
✅ serveNotice() - Main function to serve notices
✅ getRecipientAlerts() - Get alerts for a recipient
✅ notices() - Get notice details
✅ alertNotices() - Get alert details
✅ getAlertDetails() - Get comprehensive alert info

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test minting a new legal notice NFT
2. Check if NFTs appear in wallet (should work now that contract is verified!)
3. Test role management functions
4. Verify fee calculations
5. Test recipient alert retrieval

## Notes:
- The contract is now verified on TronScan ✅
- NFTs should be visible in wallets ✅
- All UI functions now match the actual contract ABI ✅
