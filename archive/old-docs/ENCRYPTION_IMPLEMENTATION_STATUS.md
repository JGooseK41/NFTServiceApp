# Encryption Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed

### 1. Smart Contract with Public Key Registry
Created `LegalNoticeNFT_WithEncryption.sol` with:
- Public key registry mapping for all users
- `registerPublicKey()` function for one-time setup
- `hasPublicKey()` to check registration status
- `getPublicKey()` to retrieve keys for encryption
- Separate methods for encrypted vs text-only notices
- Access control ensuring only recipients can decrypt after acceptance

### 2. Frontend Encryption Utilities
Created `encryption-utils.js` with:
- Key generation from wallet signatures
- Public key registration to contract
- Document encryption using AES + public key encryption
- Decryption after acceptance
- UI modals for registration flow

### 3. Frontend Integration
Created `encryption-integration.js` with:
- Encryption status display in wallet info
- Check recipient key before sending
- Warning modals for unregistered recipients
- Automatic decryption after acceptance
- Document display and download

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### For Senders:
1. Check if recipient has registered public key
2. If not, show warning with options:
   - Send text-only notice instead
   - Ask recipient to register first
3. If yes, encrypt document with recipient's key
4. Upload encrypted data to IPFS
5. Store encryption key on-chain (encrypted)

#### For Recipients:
1. One-time public key registration (~10 TRX fee)
2. Receive encrypted documents
3. Sign to accept (creates proof of service)
4. Automatic decryption after signature
5. View and download decrypted document

## üîß How It Works

### Registration Flow:
```javascript
1. User connects wallet
2. System checks if public key registered
3. If not, shows "Set Up" button
4. User clicks to register
5. Generates key from wallet signature
6. Stores public key on blockchain
```

### Encryption Flow:
```javascript
1. Sender uploads document
2. System checks recipient has public key
3. Generates random AES key
4. Encrypts document with AES
5. Encrypts AES key with recipient's public key
6. Stores encrypted data on IPFS
7. Saves encrypted key reference on-chain
```

### Decryption Flow:
```javascript
1. Recipient views notice
2. Signs to accept (Document Images only)
3. Contract marks as accepted
4. Frontend retrieves encrypted data
5. Uses wallet signature to derive decryption key
6. Decrypts AES key, then document
7. Displays decrypted content
```

## üìã Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy New Contract:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy LegalNoticeNFT_WithEncryption.sol
   # Update CONTRACT_ADDRESS in index.html
   ```

2. **Test Registration:**
   - Connect wallet
   - Check for encryption status
   - Register public key if needed

3. **Test Document Flow:**
   - Create encrypted notice
   - Verify recipient key check
   - Accept and decrypt

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Simplified Encryption:**
   - Current implementation uses simplified key derivation
   - Production should use proper ECDSA encryption libraries
   - Consider using established libraries like eth-crypto

2. **Key Management:**
   - Keys derived from wallet signatures (deterministic)
   - Users don't need to manage separate keys
   - Lost wallet = lost decryption ability

3. **IPFS Considerations:**
   - Encrypted data stored on IPFS
   - Only encryption key stored on-chain
   - Consider pinning important documents

4. **Gas Costs:**
   - Registration: ~50,000 gas (one-time)
   - Encrypted notice: ~300,000 gas
   - Text notice: ~200,000 gas

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Production Hardening:**
   - Implement proper ECDSA encryption
   - Add key rotation capability
   - Implement emergency key recovery

2. **UI Enhancements:**
   - Show encryption badge on notices
   - Better key management UI
   - Bulk encryption for multiple recipients

3. **Testing:**
   - Test with real TronLink wallets
   - Verify cross-wallet compatibility
   - Load test with large documents
