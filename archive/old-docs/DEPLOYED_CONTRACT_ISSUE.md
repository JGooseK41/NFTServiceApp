# Deployed Contract Issue

## The Problem

The contract at `TXtSpuVBTnsvCwuqDYXtiZXTpgSXZSb2Bd` appears to be **LegalNoticeNFT_Final**, not LegalNoticeNFT_Complete.

## Evidence:

1. **You are the admin** (confirmed)
2. **You already have PROCESS_SERVER_ROLE** (confirmed)
3. **setFeeExemption expects 2 arguments**, not 3
4. **The contract has `serviceFee` not `SERVICE_FEE()`**

## The Issue:

The UI is trying to call functions with the Complete contract signature, but the deployed contract is actually Final which has different function signatures:

- Complete: `setFeeExemption(address, bool, bool)` - 3 params
- Final: `setFeeExemption(address, bool)` - 2 params

## Solution:

We need to either:

1. **Deploy the LegalNoticeNFT_Complete contract** (recommended)
   - This is what we intended to deploy
   - Has all the features the UI expects

2. **Or update the UI to match LegalNoticeNFT_Final** 
   - Change all the function calls to match Final's signatures
   - Remove features that don't exist in Final

## To Deploy Complete Contract:

```bash
cd /home/jesse/projects/NFTServiceApp
PRIVATE_KEY=36466bd27e7c316abef7474c9a6c55081dd099734e376ca36dfba63d0bf521c0 node deploy_complete_contract.js
```

This will give you a new contract address that actually has all the Complete features.
