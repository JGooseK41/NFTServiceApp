### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pre-Deployment Configuration Required**

Before deploying, you MUST:

1. **Set Constructor Parameters:**
   ```solidity
   constructor() ERC721("Legal Notice NFT", "NOTICE") {
       _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
       _setupRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
       feeCollector = msg.sender; // CHANGE THIS to actual fee collector
       _noticeIdCounter.increment(); // Start at 1
   }
   ```

2. **Update Fee Collector:**
   - Current: Set to deployer address
   - Required: Set to your treasury/fee collection address

3. **Configure Initial Fees (if different from defaults):**
   - serviceFee/documentNoticeFee: 150 TRX
   - textOnlyFee: 15 TRX
   - creationFee: 75 TRX
   - sponsorshipFee: 2 TRX
   - processServerDiscount: 50%

### üìã **Deployment Steps**

1. **Update Constructor:**
   ```solidity
   feeCollector = 0xYourFeeCollectorAddress; // Replace with actual address
   ```

2. **Deploy Contract:**
   - Use TronBox or TronWeb for TRON deployment
   - Record the deployed contract address

3. **Post-Deployment Setup:**
   ```javascript
   // Grant admin roles
   await contract.grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, "admin_address_2");
   
   // Grant initial process server roles
   await contract.grantRole(PROCESS_SERVER_ROLE, "server_address_1");
   
   // Set law enforcement exemptions if needed
   await contract.setLawEnforcementExemption("agency_address", "Agency Name");
   ```

4. **Verify Contract:**
   - Verify on TronScan/Explorer
   - Test all functions on testnet first

### üîç **Final Security Considerations**

1. **Admin Key Management:**
   - Use multi-sig wallet for admin role
   - Separate deployment key from admin key
   - Consider time-locked admin functions

2. **Fee Collection:**
   - Fee collector should be a secure wallet
   - Consider automated withdrawal to cold storage
   - Monitor fee collection regularly

3. **Emergency Response:**
   - Document pause/unpause procedures
   - Have incident response plan
   - Monitor for unusual activity

### ‚úÖ **Contract is READY for Deployment**

**Status: DEPLOYMENT READY** ‚úì

The contract has:
- All security features implemented
- Proper access controls
- Event emissions for monitoring
- Gas optimizations
- Input validations
- Emergency pause functionality

**Next Steps:**
1. Update feeCollector address in constructor
2. Deploy to testnet first
3. Thoroughly test all functions
4. Deploy to mainnet
5. Update config.js with deployed address
6. Grant necessary roles post-deployment

### üìù **Testing Checklist Before Mainnet**

- [ ] Create document notice
- [ ] Create text notice
- [ ] Accept notice and receive decryption key
- [ ] Test batch operations (multiple recipients)
- [ ] Test fee calculations
- [ ] Test law enforcement exemptions
- [ ] Test process server discounts
- [ ] Test role management
- [ ] Test pause/unpause
- [ ] Test withdrawal functions
- [ ] Verify events are emitted correctly
- [ ] Test with different wallet types
