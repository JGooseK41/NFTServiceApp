## Overview
Updated the NFT Service App to provide clearer document delivery options with improved privacy notices and differentiated acceptance flows.

### 2. Two-Option System
**Document Images (150 TRX)**

- Text notice serves as cover letter/summary (publicly visible)

**Text Only (15 TRX)**
- Just public text message, no documents
- For reminders, preliminary notices
- No signature required (view-only)
- All content publicly visible on blockchain

### 3. UI Improvements

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### Notice Detection
```javascript
const isTextOnly = !notice.documentId || notice.documentId == 0;
```

#### Conditional Button Rendering
- Document notices ‚Üí Sign Receipt button

- Different styling and icons for each

#### New Functions
- `viewTextNotice()` - Display text-only notices

## User Experience Flow

### Process Server Creating Notice

1. **Selects Delivery Method:**
   - Document Images: Upload document + enter public text
   - Text Only: Enter text message only

2. **Sees Clear Warnings:**
   - Yellow boxes explain what's public
   - Text fields marked with globe icon
   - Estimated fees shown dynamically

3. **Creates Notice:**
   - Document Images always include text notice
   - No option for document-only delivery

### Recipient Receiving Notice

1. **Document Images Notice:**
   - Sees encrypted document indicator
   - Must sign to view document
   - Text summary visible immediately
   - Signature creates blockchain proof

2. **Text Only Notice:**
   - Can view immediately
   - No signature required
   - "View Notice" button instead of "Sign Receipt"
   - Marked as "No signature required"

## Benefits

1. **Clarity** - Users understand exactly what's public vs private

## Future Considerations

3. **Key Management** - Handle wallet public key retrieval
4. **Decryption UI** - Smooth experience after signing
