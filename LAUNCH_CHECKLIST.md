## 🔍 Testing URLs

### Test Workflow System
Open the test page to verify all components:
- File: `/test-workflow.html`
- This page allows testing:
  - System status check
  - Notice creation
  - Backend sync
  - Dashboard loading
  - Receipt generation

### Production URLs
- Frontend: https://theblockservice.com
- Backend API: https://nft-legal-service-backend.onrender.com

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Backend Connection
If backend shows offline:
- The Render backend may be sleeping (free tier)
- First request will wake it up (takes ~30 seconds)
- Subsequent requests will be fast

### Issue 2: Case Not Showing
If a case doesn't appear immediately:
1. Click the "Refresh" button in the dashboard
2. Check if blockchain sync is complete
3. Verify the server address matches

### Issue 3: Receipt Generation Fails
If receipts don't generate:
1. Ensure notice has blockchain confirmation
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try refreshing the page
