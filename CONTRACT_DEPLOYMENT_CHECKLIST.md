# Contract Deployment Checklist

## Contract Improvements Added

### 1. **Essential Missing Functions**
- ✅ `totalNotices()` - Returns total number of notices created
- ✅ `getUserNotices()` - Alias for `getRecipientNotices()` for UI compatibility
- ✅ `getServerNotices()` - Alias for `getSenderNotices()` for UI compatibility

### 2. **Enhanced Query Functions**
- ✅ `getNoticesByStatus()` - Filter notices by accepted/pending status
- ✅ `getNoticesByDateRange()` - Get notices within specific date range
- ✅ `getServerStats()` - Get comprehensive statistics for a process server

### 3. **Batch Operations**
- ✅ `createBatchTextNotices()` - Send same text notice to multiple recipients in one transaction
- ✅ `createBatchDocumentNotices()` - Send same document notice to multiple recipients in one transaction
- ✅ `acceptMultipleNotices()` - Accept multiple notices in one transaction (saves gas)

**Batch Operation Benefits:**
- Process servers can send the same notice to up to 20 recipients in a single transaction
- Significant gas savings compared to individual transactions
- Automatic fee calculation for all recipients
- Individual NFTs minted for each recipient
- Each notice gets a unique sequential number (e.g., "Foreclosure Notice #1", "#2", etc.)

### 4. **Missing Events**
- ✅ `FeesSponsored` event added for tracking sponsorship payments

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. **Contract Configuration**
- [ ] Set correct `feeCollector` address
- [ ] Verify all fee amounts are appropriate:
  - `serviceFee`: 150 TRX (Document Images)
  - `textOnlyFee`: 15 TRX
  - `creationFee`: 75 TRX (Process servers)
  - `sponsorshipFee`: 2 TRX
- [ ] Confirm `processServerDiscount`: 50%

### 2. **Security Considerations**
- [ ] Contract has pause functionality for emergencies
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] ReentrancyGuard applied to payment functions
- [ ] Input validation on all public functions

### 3. **Gas Optimization**
- [ ] Consider implementing batch notice creation for process servers
- [ ] Storage patterns are optimized (using mappings efficiently)
- [ ] Events emit only necessary indexed parameters

### 4. **Testing Requirements**
- [ ] Test all notice creation flows (document & text)
- [ ] Test fee calculations with various user types
- [ ] Test law enforcement exemptions
- [ ] Test process server registration and management
- [ ] Test batch operations
- [ ] Test withdrawal functions
- [ ] Test pause/unpause functionality

### 5. **UI Compatibility**
- [ ] All UI function calls now have matching contract functions
- [ ] Legacy function names maintained for backward compatibility
- [ ] Event names match UI expectations

### 6. **Deployment Steps**
1. Deploy contract to testnet first
2. Verify all functions work as expected
3. Test with UI integration
4. Audit gas costs for typical operations
5. Deploy to mainnet
6. Update UI with mainnet contract address
7. Transfer admin roles to appropriate addresses
8. Set up monitoring for contract events

## Post-Deployment

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Grant PROCESS_SERVER_ROLE to initial servers
- [ ] Set law enforcement exemptions if needed
- [ ] Verify feeCollector is receiving payments
- [ ] Monitor first few transactions closely

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up event monitoring for NoticeCreated events
- [ ] Track gas usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor fee collection
- [ ] Watch for any reverted transactions

## Additional Considerations

### Future Enhancements
1. **Batch Document Notices**: Add function to create multiple document notices
2. **Notice Templates**: Store common notice formats for reuse
3. **Automated Reminders**: Consider off-chain service for deadline reminders
4. **Statistics Dashboard**: Implement more comprehensive on-chain analytics
5. **Fee Adjustments**: Consider dynamic fee adjustments based on network conditions

### Known Limitations
1. No on-chain document storage (uses IPFS)
2. Encryption keys stored on-chain (consider alternatives)
3. No automatic expiration of notices
4. Limited to TRC-721 standard features

### Integration Notes
- UI expects certain legacy function names (maintained via aliases)
- Energy rental system handles transaction costs separately
- Contract emits events that UI monitors for real-time updates
