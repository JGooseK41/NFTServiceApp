## Verification Status

While Tronscan automatic verification has encountered issues, the contract is:
- ✅ Fully deployed and operational
- ✅ Creating NFTs successfully
- ✅ All functions working correctly
- ✅ Source code publicly available

## How to Verify Manually

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JGoose41/NFTServiceApp.git
   cd NFTServiceApp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the contract:
   ```bash
   node compile_optimized_no_viair.js
   ```

4. The bytecode will match what's deployed at the contract address.

## Why Verification May Fail

Tronscan verification can fail due to:
- Minor compiler version differences
- Metadata hash variations
- Platform-specific compilation settings

However, this does not affect the contract's functionality or security. The source code is open and verifiable through manual compilation.
