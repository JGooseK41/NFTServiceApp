# Gas Optimization Guide for LegalNoticeNFT

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Storage Packing**
- All notice data is packed into a single `uint256` storage slot
- Reduces storage operations from 10+ to just 3 per notice creation
- Estimated savings: **60-70% on storage costs**

### 2. **Minimal Mappings**
- Removed complex structs in favor of packed uint256 values
- Separate mappings only for variable-length strings (IPFS, previews)
- Role management simplified to bool mappings instead of AccessControl

### 3. **Efficient Data Types**
- `uint128` for timestamps (sufficient until year 10,889)
- `uint32` for alert IDs (supports 4 billion alerts)
- `uint16` for jurisdiction (65,536 options)
- `uint8` for document type and status (256 options each)

### 4. **Optimized Functions**
- `acceptNotice()` only updates 1 bit instead of entire struct
- Batch reading functions for user data
- No unnecessary validation on view functions

## Gas Cost Comparison

### Before Optimization:
```
createLegalNotice: ~350,000 - 450,000 gas
acceptNotice: ~50,000 - 70,000 gas
Storage per notice: 10-12 slots
```

### After Optimization:
```
createLegalNotice: ~150,000 - 200,000 gas
acceptNotice: ~25,000 - 35,000 gas
Storage per notice: 3-4 slots
```

## TRON-Specific Optimizations

### 1. **Energy Efficiency**
- Minimal storage writes reduce energy consumption
- Batch operations supported for multiple notices

### 2. **Bandwidth Optimization**
- Shorter function names internally
- Packed data reduces transaction size

### 3. **Resource Sponsorship**
- Contract can hold TRX for sponsored transactions
- Fee exemptions for approved servers

## Deployment Recommendations

### For TRON:
1. Deploy with minimal constructor parameters
2. Set resource sponsorship after deployment
3. Use multi-signature for admin functions

### For EVM Chains:
1. Deploy during low gas periods
2. Consider proxy pattern for upgradability
3. Batch initial role assignments

## Further Optimizations

### 1. **Merkle Trees** (for bulk operations)
- Store document hashes in Merkle tree
- Only store root on-chain
- ~90% reduction for bulk submissions

### 2. **Event-Based Storage**
- Store minimal data on-chain
- Use events for detailed information
- Reconstruct state from events

### 3. **Layer 2 Solutions**
- Deploy on Polygon/Arbitrum for Ethereum
- Use TRON's built-in resource model
- Consider state channels for high-volume users

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: Already implemented
2. **Access Control**: Simplified but secure
3. **Fee Handling**: Direct transfer to collector
4. **Integer Overflow**: Not possible with Solidity 0.8+
