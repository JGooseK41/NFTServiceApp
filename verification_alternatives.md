# Contract Verification Alternatives

Since Tronscan may not support Via IR verification, here are your options:

## Option 1: Try Standard JSON Input Verification
Some explorers support Via IR through Standard JSON Input format. Try this on Tronscan:

1. Go to contract verification page
2. Select "Solidity (Standard-Json-Input)" if available
3. Create a JSON file with:

```json
{
  "language": "Solidity",
  "sources": {
    "LegalNoticeNFT_Hybrid.sol": {
      "content": "// Paste flattened contract here"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "optimizer": {
      "enabled": true,
      "runs": 10
    },
    "viaIR": true,
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": {
        "*": ["*"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 2: Accept Unverified Status
The contract works correctly even without verification:
- NFTs are being minted successfully
- All functions work as expected
- Users can still interact with the contract
- Only source code visibility is affected

## Option 3: Provide Source Code Externally
1. Create a GitHub repository with the contract source
2. Add verification info in README
3. Link to it from your application
4. Shows transparency without Tronscan verification

## Option 4: Wait for Via IR Support
- Etherscan, Polygonscan already support Via IR
- Tronscan may add support in future updates
- Contract remains functional meanwhile

## Option 5: Alternative Verification Approach
Try these compiler settings one by one:
1. v0.8.20 with runs=10, viaIR=true
2. v0.8.19 with runs=10, viaIR=true  
3. v0.8.0 with runs=10, viaIR=true
4. Try without specifying viaIR (some verifiers ignore it)

## Current Contract Status
- Contract is deployed and functional
- NFTs minting successfully
- Metadata visible in wallets
- All features working correctly

## Recommendation
Since the contract is working properly, I recommend:
1. Try Option 1 (Standard JSON) if available
2. If that fails, use Option 3 (external documentation)
3. The lack of verification doesn't affect functionality
