# ðŸš€ Mainnet Contract Deployment Checklist

## Critical Contract Changes Before Mainnet

### 1. Fee Structure Review
- [ ] Review and finalize service fee amount (currently set in contract)
- [ ] Review creation fee for process servers
- [ ] Review sponsorship fee amounts
- [ ] Ensure fee collector address is set to production wallet

### 2. Access Control & Security
- [ ] Verify admin role will be assigned to secure multi-sig wallet
- [ ] Review all role-based permissions (PROCESS_SERVER_ROLE, ADMIN_ROLE)
- [ ] Consider implementing role renunciation functions
- [ ] Add emergency pause mechanism if not present

### 3. Contract Parameters
- [ ] Set appropriate token name and symbol for production
- [ ] Review metadata URI structure
- [ ] Verify IPFS gateway URLs are production-ready
- [ ] Check all hardcoded values and addresses

### 4. Gas Optimization
- [ ] Review contract for gas optimization opportunities
- [ ] Consider implementing resource sponsorship settings
- [ ] Optimize storage usage patterns

### 5. Security Considerations
- [ ] Complete external security audit
- [ ] Fix any identified vulnerabilities
- [ ] Add reentrancy guards if missing
- [ ] Verify all external calls are safe
- [ ] Check for integer overflow/underflow protection

### 6. Contract Upgradeability
- [ ] Decide if contract should be upgradeable
- [ ] If yes, implement proxy pattern
- [ ] If no, ensure all critical parameters can be updated

### 7. Event Emissions
- [ ] Verify all critical actions emit events
- [ ] Ensure event parameters are indexed appropriately
- [ ] Add any missing events for off-chain monitoring

### 8. Testing Requirements
- [ ] Complete unit test coverage (target: >95%)
- [ ] Perform integration testing on testnet
- [ ] Stress test with high transaction volume
- [ ] Test all edge cases and failure scenarios

### 9. Legal & Compliance
- [ ] Ensure contract complies with legal notice requirements
- [ ] Verify metadata structure meets legal standards
- [ ] Add required legal disclaimers if needed
- [ ] Consider jurisdiction-specific requirements

### 10. Documentation
- [ ] Update all contract documentation
- [ ] Document all functions and parameters
- [ ] Create deployment runbook
- [ ] Document emergency procedures

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Contract Code Review
- [ ] Remove all debug code and console logs
- [ ] Remove test-only functions
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded test addresses
- [ ] Check for TODO/FIXME comments

### Economic Model
- [ ] Verify fee distribution logic
- [ ] Test fee collection mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure no fee can lock contract
- [ ] Verify refund mechanisms if any

### Integration Points
- [ ] Test IPFS integration thoroughly
- [ ] Verify frontend compatibility
- [ ] Test wallet integrations
- [ ] Verify event monitoring setup

## Deployment Steps

1. **Final Testnet Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy to testnet with mainnet parameters
   - [ ] Run complete test suite
   - [ ] Monitor for 48-72 hours
   - [ ] Document any issues

2. **Mainnet Preparation**
   - [ ] Secure deployment wallet
   - [ ] Prepare deployment scripts
   - [ ] Set up monitoring infrastructure
   - [ ] Prepare incident response plan

3. **Deployment Execution**
   - [ ] Deploy during low-traffic period
   - [ ] Verify contract deployment
   - [ ] Set initial parameters
   - [ ] Transfer ownership to multi-sig

4. **Post-Deployment**
   - [ ] Verify all functions work correctly
   - [ ] Monitor first transactions closely
   - [ ] Set up alerts for anomalies
   - [ ] Update all documentation with mainnet addresses

## Emergency Procedures

- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Prepare emergency pause implementation
- [ ] Set up emergency contact procedures
- [ ] Create incident response runbook

## Notes

- Contract appears complete according to verification report
- Current deployment guides focus on testnet
- Need to review actual contract code for specific mainnet requirements
- Consider professional audit before mainnet deployment
